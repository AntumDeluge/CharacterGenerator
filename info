  The generator will combine multiple assets, that may be under different licensing restrictions,
  into a single image. The resulting output image <em>must</em> be used and distributed under the
  most restrictive of the licenses. E.g., if the output image is a combination of an image under
  CC BY 4.0 and another under CC BY-SA 4.0, then the output as a whole falls under the restrictions
  of CC BY-SA 4.0.
